        	<h2>One</h2>
        	<p>My work explores the relationship between postmodern discourse and UFO sightings.</p>
			<p>With influences as diverse as Derrida and L Ron Hubbard, new insights are crafted from both orderly and random textures.</p>
            <p>Ever since I was a child I have been fascinated by the endless oscillation of the universe. What starts out as contemplation soon becomes debased into a carnival of defeat, leaving only a sense of decadence and the prospect of a new reality.</p>
            <p>As intermittent replicas become clarified through studious and critical practice, the viewer is left with a summary of the inaccuracies of our culture.</p>

        	<p>As spatial replicas become distorted through diligent and critical practice, the viewer is left with a glimpse of the limits of our world.</p>

			<p>With influences as diverse as Caravaggio and Joni Mitchell, new tensions are crafted from both simple and complex structures.</p>
            <p>Ever since I was a teenager I have been fascinated by the ephemeral nature of the human condition. What starts out as contemplation soon becomes debased into a cacophony of lust, leaving only a sense of failing and the prospect of a new understanding.</p>
            <p>As temporal phenomena become frozen through frantic and academic practice, the viewer is left with a new agenda of the corners of our culture.</p>

        	<h2>Three</h2>
        	<p>My work explores the relationship between Bauhausian sensibilities and football chants.</p>
			<p>With influences as diverse as Machiavelli and Joni Mitchell, new variations are generated from both traditional and modern discourse.</p>
            <p>Ever since I was a teenager I have been fascinated by the traditional understanding of the universe. What starts out as yearning soon becomes corroded into a dialectic of lust, leaving only a sense of dread and the inevitability of a new order.</p>
            <p>As wavering phenomena become frozen through emergent and diverse practice, the viewer is left with a glimpse of the edges of our era.</p>

			<p>With influences as diverse as Nietzsche and Frida Kahlo, new synergies are distilled from both mundane and transcendant layers.</p>
            <p>Ever since I was a pre-adolescent I have been fascinated by the ephemeral nature of relationships. What starts out as triumph soon becomes corroded into a dialectic of defeat, leaving only a sense of unreality and the prospect of a new order.</p>
            <p>As wavering phenomena become frozen through studious and critical practice, the viewer is left with an insight into the darkness of our era.</p>
